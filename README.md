## Basic Principles
 - Easy to navigate by having no circular dependencies or repeated entry points to the same experience but rather having one thing just have one expected behavior.
 - App designed in a way that the real content i.e. the jokes are the most easily readable content on it and come out above anything else throughout without fail.
 - Color combinations kept to the minimum and consistent throughout the app to provide a seamless experience that doesnt break thoughts.
 - App designed in a way that the stream itself is able to support a lot of the content to take the most advantage of infinite scroll and provide a engaging daily joke digest.
